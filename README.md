Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? I've always been really interested in the concept of lifelogging, and this will be my first foray into it I guess? The original template (and idea) comes from @una. Also there are lots of interesting studies on accountability, and I have a life goals Trello board and a bunch of Workflowy and Todoist lists already, so this is a logical addition.
