Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? 
In 2017 I've decided to go back to basics and learn JavaScript in depth using @ericelliott's [guide](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711#.6xl31hdeb) to learning JavaScript.

I have a problem staying focused, the JavaScipt ecosystem is full of shiny new libraries and framework, it's easy to lose focus and try them all without learning JavaScript deeply. So this is a tool to help me focus on one thing for as long as possible.

# Overarching Goal for January - December 2017: Back to Basics

1. Contribute to Open Source
2. Write more blog posts (More than once a month)
3. Launch my developer career
4. Get better at JavaScript
5. Cultivate daily habits (reading: actual books and coding articles, coding, journalling, podcasts?)
6. Give a talk (or talks!)
7. Do more community stuff
